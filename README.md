- Needs the ffmpeg codec

## How to install ffmpeg on Mac OSX?

Make sure you have **homebrew** installed. Then run following command:

```
brew install ffmpeg --with-libvpx --with-theora --whit-libogg --with-libvorbis

```

Btw, I wanted to thank muaz-khan for all the libraries, demos, examples he has provided for WEBRTC.
